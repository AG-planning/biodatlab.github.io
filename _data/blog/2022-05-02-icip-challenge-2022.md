Parasitic infections are one of the leading causes of death and other ailments worldwide. Detecting such infections using traditional
diagnostic procedures requires experienced medical technologists together with a significant amount of time and effort.
An automated procedure with the ability to accurately detect parasitic diseases can accelerate the process greatly.
Hence, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based parasitic egg detection pipeline. We trained deep learning models using parasitic
egg detection and classification datasets provided by ICIP Challenge 2022.

We are now rank 2 on the public leaderboard (see [here](https://icip2022challenge.piclab.ai/leaderboard/)) where we get an
mIoU score of 92.946 and mF1Score of 98.633. The competition ends on May 31, 2022. Hopefully, we will rank on top 3 after the
competition finishes. We will explain more on the approaches we use on the paper and this blog post.
