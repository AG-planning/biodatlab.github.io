metaDescription: Starting the lab at Mahidol University
---

This is our lab first blog moving to Mahidol University, Thailand. I just started the
lab and set things up. Mainly, I still work on my research from my PhD which are
applying machine learning and natural language processing to improve scientific processes.

# Interests

- **Science of Science**: one of my core research and interest is to make science and education better.
    I have collaborated with multiple conferences to implement ML and NLP tools to improve in this space.
    We also implemented at Neuromatch conference and Neuromatch Summer School which aim to democratize
    how scientists get access to conferences and proper computational trainings respectively.
    Moreover, I collaborate with the National Institute of Health aiming to use NLP to better
    understand the funding process.
- **Thai Natural Language Prcessing**: In extension to science of science, one of my long interest
    is to expand my research in Thai Natural Language Processing. Comparing to other languages,
    we still have lower datasets and resources. Pushing on open source software, models, and datasets
    will help push Thailand .
- **Applied ML and NLP for biomedical use cases**: Through my PhDs, I also collaborate with many people
    to apply computational tools for human movements.
