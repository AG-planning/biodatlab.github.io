metaDescription: Some resources before joining the lab
---

Joining the lab might be overwhelming since we work on a broacd range of applied machine learning
and natural language processing. As most of students may come from biomedical background, learning some
tools as you join the lab will be very useful later on. There are a few tools which are very useful.
I listed below:

## Shell Script

Many times, we need it to run our scripts, move files, check files in directories, or updating packages.
Understand shell scripts are very useful here. There are a lot of resources online where you can
find tutorials on shell scripts (Bash, Zsh, ...). I list some of them below.

- [bluebirz.net tutorial on Bash](https://www.bluebirz.net/1580/lets-play-bash-script/)

## Version control

We generally use `git` as our version control and store many repositories on GitHub.
Here, familarize yourself with Git will help a lot in your code development.

- Linkedin Git Essential Training: The Basics

There are many more tutorials today. Make sure you know all the basic terms such as add,
pull, fetch, merge, pull request.
## Python

Python has been used in a lot of our development. Therefore, programming in Python is almost needed
if you decide to join the lab. There are a lot of resources on how to learn Python. Try to
learn linear algebra, data science, and machine learning with some of the Python libraries such as
`numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Today, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) is prevalent in science. Knowing some of them
is useful. However, make sure that you learn the core concept of learning algorithms before applying
ML or DL. There are multiple free online classes that you can learn ML and DL such as Andrew Ng's Machine Learning,
or [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/).
